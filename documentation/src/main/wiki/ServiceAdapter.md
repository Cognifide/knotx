# Service Adapter
Service Adapter is Component of a system, that mediate communication between Knot.x [[Service Knot|ServiceKnot]]
and external services that deliver data injected into template. In short, Service Adapter acts as a
`proxy` between Knot.x and external services.

## How does it work?
Service Adapter accepts message with the following data:

- `clientRequest` - object with all data of an original request,
- `params` - all additional params defined in configuration.

Result generated by Action Adapter must be a JsonObject with the fields as below:
- `clientResponse` - Json Object, `body` field of this response is suppose to carry on the actual response from the mocked service,

Find out more about contract described above in [[Service Knot|ServiceKnot]] section.

## How to configure?
Configuration of Service Adapter is specific to its implementation. You may see example configuration 
of [[Http Service Adapter|HttpServiceAdapter#how-to-configure]].

## How to extend?
Implementing custom Service Adapter that meet your project requirements allows 
you to adopt request from Knot.x into request understandable by an endpoint service, and adopts 
responses from that service into unified message understandable by Knot.x.
For you convenience, Knot.x comes with implementation of a [[Service Adapter|ServiceAdapter]], 
that enables communication with external services using HTTP Protocol. 
See [[Http Service Adapter|HttpServiceAdapter]] for more information.
Please note, that this implementation is very generic and we recommend to create project-specific 
adapters for any custom solution.

Writing custom Service Adapter requires fulfilling [[Service Knot|ServiceKnot]] contract.
