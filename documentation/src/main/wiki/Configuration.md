# Configuration

TODO:

- How configuration is glued together
- How bootstrap.json is working
  - load file, multiple files, directory
  - scanning changes
  - use hocon and/or json
- How application.conf is structured
  - basic HOCON syntax options (dot notation, brackets, references, comments, etc.)
  - how to include files (required/optional), where the include should be placed
- How errors are validated for includes, references
- Maybe sample config ? reference to bootrsrap, example ?/
