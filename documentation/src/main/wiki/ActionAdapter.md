Action Adapter is Component of a system, that mediate communication between Knot.x [[Action Knot|ActionKnot]] 
and external Services that are responsible for handling form submission.

Action Adapter is an extension of Knot.x. 
By delivering custom implementations of Action Adapters, that meet your project requirements, it allows 
you to adopt request from Knot.x into request understandable by endpoint service, and adopts 
responses from that service into unified message understandable by Knot.x.
For you convenience, Knot.x is shipped with a default Action Adapter called `HttpActionAdapter`.

Action Adapter accepts message with the following data:

- `ClientRequest` - object with all data of an original request,
- `params` - all additional params defined in configuration.

Result generated by Action Adapter must be a JsonObject with the fields as below:
- `clientResponse` - Json Object, `body` field of this response is suppose to carry on the actual response from the mocked service,
- `signal` - string that defines how original request processing should be handled, see more in [[Action Knot|ActionKnot]].
