Knot.x is a lightweight and high-performance **reactive microservice assembler**. It allows you to get rid of all the dynamic data from your content repository and put it into a fast and scalable world of microservices.

We care a lot about speed and that is why we built it on [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/), known as one of the leading frameworks for performant, event-driven applications.

# How it works

A simplified description of Knot.x can be `a tool which converts a static page (template) into 
dynamic page driven by data provided by microservices`.
